# Unlocking Insights with Data: My Power BI Dashboard Project

Transforming data into actionable insights is a rewarding process. In my latest project, I designed a Power BI dashboard to analyze customer shopping trends, uncovering insights that businesses can use to drive strategy.

# Data Preparation

Using Power Query, I transformed raw data into a structured format by:

- Standardizing column names for clarity.

- Removing irrelevant columns to streamline analysis.

- Splitting and renaming the "Color-Size" column for better granularity.

- Converting review ratings from text to decimals for quantitative insights.

# Key Metrics
- Total Purchase Amount: $233K
- Average Purchase Amount: $59.76
- Average Review Rating: 3.75
  
# Insights Gained

This project reinforced my expertise in Power BI and taught me the value of turning data into meaningful business strategies.
